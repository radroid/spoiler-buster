# Spoiler Buster
We are a group of enthusiastic data scientists who are working to create an extension that will help users avoid spoilers when surfing the web. We are creating an **`Google Chrome extension`** that **`blocks spoilers`** of any **`movies, TV shows or books`** you are wish to not ruin for you. The video below shows a demonstration of version 1 of the extension (with 50% of the features).
